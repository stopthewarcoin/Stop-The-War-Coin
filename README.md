Stop The War Coin (STW) is more than just a cryptocurrency. It's a movement that transcends traditional financial systems to establish a global community united by the common goal of ending wars and promoting harmony.

Transaction Fees: 0% taxes on buying or selling, ensuring fair trading without hidden costs.
Contract Address: 0x779a10E41011094b836e92adBe55bE521c6E7CBA

Peace Messages
One of the standout features of Stop The War Coin is the ability of token holders to register peace messages on the Binance Smart Chain (BNB) blockchain. These messages are permanently recorded, ensuring they remain immutable and publicly accessible forever. This feature underscores the transparency and permanence that blockchain technology offers to global peace advocacy.

Key Activities and Goals
Disseminating Peace Messages: Our team actively uses Twitter to reply to tweets from influential leaders and organizations with peace messages recorded on the blockchain by STW holders. Over 13,000 peace messages have been sent since the project's inception.
Raising Awareness about Mainstream Media: We inform the public about how mainstream media, influenced by elite interests, often acts as a tool for propagating war agendas.
Community Growth and Engagement: Aligning the crypto community towards a common cause, we aim to attract more participants who are passionate about global peace.
Community Involvement
We encourage holders to propose their peace messages, which are then broadcast to political leaders and institutions. This collective effort amplifies the community's voice, making a significant impact on global peace advocacy. By using STW tokens to register these messages on the blockchain, every holder becomes part of a larger narrative promoting peace.

Peace messages examples by our holders : 

I hate all wars - STW COIN project dev
War... is as much a punishment to the punisher as to the sufferer.
War settles nothing.
Peace is constructed, not fought for.
Let's make this world a better place...let's end conflict once and for all.
I want the conflict in Ukraine to end.
The people of Russia are not the enemy. The people of Ukraine are not the enemy. War is the enemy. #StopTheWar #NoMoreWar
We don't want a nuclear war, do something to stop this war.
The war will end, the leaders shake hands, and that old woman will remain waiting for her martyred son, and that girl will wait for her beloved husband, and those children will wait for their heroic father. I don't know who sold the homeland!
Stop the war now!
Greed must disappear as soon as possible, this is a very terrible quality that can ruin a bright future. The future belongs to good people who will live in such a beautiful world that it is difficult for us to even imagine now.
War - What is it good for....Absolutely nothing..
Weapons are instruments of fear; they are not a wise man's tools. He uses them only when he has no choice. Peace and quiet are dear to his heart. And victory no cause for rejoicing. If you rejoice in victory, then you delight in killing; If you delight in killing, you cannot fulfill yourself.
STOP THE WAR
War is bad, it steals, kills, destroys destinies. Those are generation of men wiped out, fathers, husbands, sons, grandsons, all for what??? When will it be enough??
Memento mori
War settles nothing.
Only thing war is good for is taking innocent lives.
#endwar
"War should be treated as murder is treated. It should be regarded with equal horror and with equal aversion ... There are many ways of showing courage without having to kill other people, and it is such ways that should be encouraged." Bertrand Russell
The real and lasting victories are those of peace and not of war. – Ralph Waldo Emerson
THE MOST LETHAL VIRUS IS NOT COVID. IT IS WAR.
Peace Is Always Beautiful
Either man will abolish war or war will abolish man
Every war is a war against children.
God does not back war
Any peace is better than any war
