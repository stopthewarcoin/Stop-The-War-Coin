Peace Messages
One of the standout features of Stop The War Coin is the ability of token holders to register peace messages on the Binance Smart Chain (BNB) blockchain. These messages are permanently recorded, ensuring they remain immutable and publicly accessible forever. This feature underscores the transparency and permanence that blockchain technology offers to global peace advocacy.

Key Activities and Goals
Disseminating Peace Messages: Our team actively uses Twitter to reply to tweets from influential leaders and organizations with peace messages recorded on the blockchain by STW holders. Over 13,000 peace messages have been sent since the project's inception.
Raising Awareness about Mainstream Media: We inform the public about how mainstream media, influenced by elite interests, often acts as a tool for propagating war agendas.
Community Growth and Engagement: Aligning the crypto community towards a common cause, we aim to attract more participants who are passionate about global peace.
Community Involvement
We encourage holders to propose their peace messages, which are then broadcast to political leaders and institutions. This collective effort amplifies the community's voice, making a significant impact on global peace advocacy. By using STW tokens to register these messages on the blockchain, every holder becomes part of a larger narrative promoting peace.
